I've sunk over 15 years of my life into the tech industry. I have run the gamut from level 2 support for a code base I wasn't allowed to see to a sought out expert for automating the deployment of applications in AWS. Since then, I have carved out a niche at my current employer running IAM and (amateur) security for my employer.

A lot more is going to develop here, but first I need to do some customizations of this Hugo theme.
