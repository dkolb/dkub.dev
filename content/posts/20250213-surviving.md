The past few weeks I've been struggling to find something to do with my evening. The husband and I are very much the sort of folks who love each other very much but also like some alone time. Usually after dinner, we split up. Me? I've been struggling to do anything but doom scroll until I'm convinced I'm going to die in gitmo. It's shockingly possible in my opinion. However, it's not productive to spiral over it. So tonight, I've decided to do a bit of journaling.

This post is very lightly edited and very much a stream of conciousness. Events are not in chronological order, but rather mindmap order.

I came up in rural Georgia through the 90s and 00s. I was supposed to graduate Class of 2001. I was a emo-kinda-goth sophmore in high school when the Columbine Shooting occured. I had been bullied some before and I was out. Matthew Shepard's death intensified the bullying, but also garnered sympathy from teachers. So it was a bit of a balance.

Columbine changed the entire dynamic to something far worse. Students bullied me out of fear. The administration gave me a pat down every day I got off the bus for the next two and half years I attended that high school. My car was searched four times during school lockdowns run by the sheriff looking for drugs. I was suspended for having a "hit list" in my bookbag. It was a list of people labeled, "Interviews for Essay on Josh's Expulsion."[^1] I participated in a day of silence for LGBTQ+ students (LGBT at the time) and the PE teacher held a Day of Prayer that same day and forced me to sit in the gym while the entire class prayed for me. The list of abuses by full grown adults charged with my safety just goes on and on.

Through all this, the students around me did not let up. I would always get into more trouble than the students that bullied me. They'd say I started it. That I said something weird. One time, I even got beat up for, "looking at us in the bathroom while just standing at a urinal not pissing."[^2] 

I found safety in a small collection of Emo/Goth theater kids. No, not the Glee Club. This was the tech theater kids. We built sets and moved shit around during the shows. Acting was not for us. That was for the popular kids. Candace, the local news anchor's daughter, got the best parts and chose her leading man based on who she wanted to date.

However, even they were the rough sort of friends. One friend, who ended up a transman, bugged me trying to tell me he had a new drug called "Seed". It was red pepper flakes. I knew it was red pepper flakes. I put them in my mouth and stared at him, blankly. "My parents have an entire shelf in the fridge dedicated to Habanero and Ghost Pepper sauces." He still claims to have tricked me to this day.

They called me, Fungus. Because no one really liked me at first but I kinda grew on them all. We smoked weed. We picked on each other. I was definitely the bottom of the totem pole in the group. That said, they still hooked me up with my first boyfriend: the high school football team's mascot. Through him, I slept around with a few of the football players. He graduated my junior year. He left behind a group of guys who would never own up to fucking me but also defended me. It made the days ever so slightly more bearable.

I ended up doing Dual Enrollment at college. The freedom was too much, and I flunked out. I returned to that hell of a school to try to salvage a diploma. The rumor mill spun wildly, claiming I was dealing drugs and running a prostitution ring in the high school. I was in and out of in-school suspension. I dropped out halfway through my final semester. I ran away from home.

Well, ran away is not the best description. I was eighteen. I left my car at my mother's house and had a friend drop me off outside of town headed north. I hitchhiked to San Francisco and back to Tampa-ish, FL. I lived in a trailer down there. Got my GED.

Eventually I made my way home, only to fall into meth. In small town USA, the Venn diagram of gay men who are kinky and gay men who do meth is a circle. I eventually quit and managed to get into college in a very narrow window where my sophmore SAT scores were still valid.

It would be decades before I could untangle my kinks from drug abuse. I was terrified of it leading to relapse. The few times I relented to my darker desires in college, I'd end up right back in a meth den.

Society *broke* me in ways I've never fully healed. A lot of my 20s were just bad decision after bad decision all rooted in, "Well if I'm a monster, let me be a fucking monster worthy of the title." I lived fast and hard and with no plan for living past 30. This may seem typical of all young adults, but in the gay community it was rampant. The struggle to just exist in this environment was too much. The only media representation I had showed me as a tragic character to be thrown out of my home to die of AIDS or an overdose in a ditch. The final alternative was to die hustling so they could make an episode of SVU. Even with a supportive mother, many of these things were so overwhelmingly present in media and peer groups they became self-fulfilling prophecies in my life.

This experience is extremely typical for queer kids in the 90s and 00s.

I'm watching a lot of trauma unfurl amongst my younger friends. The Trans community, online and local, is in crisis. The gays (well those with sense) are terrified. It all feels like the 90s/00s are coming back. Except instead of coming up in that mess, the kids know what is possible. They saw what progress looked like and they've lived a soft life of acceptance. That is not a weakness. That is a strength. We may have lived the School of Homophobic And Transphobic Hard Knocks, but we never knew it could be better. Some of us dreamt of it being better, but we didn't *know* it. That's a hell of a motivation to fight.

I'm hoping the Internet makes it harder to completely stamp us out. It's crazy that the best hope I have is a Very Boring Cyberpunk Dystopia where the rest of us proles all live in the underbelly slums of cities. There, we are largely forgotten by the government and police. I'd rather live a dangerous and lawless life with my fellow LGBTQIA+'s than some of the other alternatives.

Regardless, I'd rather die than be anything less than what I am today. I've spent more than 20 years healing from the ways society hurt me. I've devoured my demons lest they devour me, leaned into them, and used them for strength. This time, I'm wiser. This time, I have places to vent my rage productively. This time, I have my kinks to vent my self-destructive tendencies and anxiety into.

And this time, I'm not afraid.

[^2]: To this day, using a public restroom causes a sort of ghost anxiety that registers just above the baseline. However, even as late as my early 30s, I would avoid eye contact, prefer stalls over urinals, and piss as loudly as possible. There's an art to this. You need to push a bit and aim for the urinal cake or water. Waterless urinals require more pushing and occasionally clenching your prostate a little because the start/stop makes a good bit of noise.
