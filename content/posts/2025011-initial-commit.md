Hoo boy here we go again! I'm trying to blog. We'll see how successful I am.

This is a home mostly for long-form content. I expect to be extracting and upgrading some WriteFreely posts from my old blog over the next few months. Until then, this post will have to hold space for the lyrics of Defying Gravity. Lol.
